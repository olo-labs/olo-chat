# Olo Chat

A chat interface for **Olo** — start conversations, send messages, and follow run events in real time.

## For users

- **Chat** — Pick a **preset** (role) beside the composer: Ask, Fast, Detailed, and others from backend workflow config. Subtitle **Conversation with Olo AI**. While the model runs, you see **who is thinking** and a short **summary** line; message history shows **which preset** was used per turn. **Run again** (under user messages) lists other presets by **emoji + name**. Run events in the **Events** sidebar; **human** steps show **buttons** from the worker.
- **Knowledge** — Manage knowledge sources and see status (placeholders).
- **Documents** — Upload files to the backend shared storage.

The app talks to the **Olo backend** for sessions, messages, and events. **Tenant** is determined by the backend; **task queue** comes from the selected preset.

## Quick start

1. Start the **olo backend** (port 7080), e.g. `start.bat` from the `olo` folder.
2. From this directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open **http://localhost:3000**.

For backend setup, environment variables, Docker, and technical details, see **docs** below.
